## Code Samples

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```python
async def process_claim_with_agents(claim_id: str):
    # Initialize specialized agents
    agents = {
        'intake': DocumentIntakeAgent(),
        'validator': PolicyValidationAgent(),
        'fraud': FraudDetectionAgent(),
        'calculator': SettlementCalculatorAgent()
    }
    
    # Orchestrate workflow
    async with WorkflowOrchestrator() as orchestrator:
        # Stage 1: Parallel document processing
        intake_result = await agents['intake'].process(claim_id)
        
        # Stage 2: Concurrent validation
        validation_tasks = [
            agents['validator'].validate(intake_result),
            agents['fraud'].analyze(intake_result)
        ]
        validation_result, fraud_result = await asyncio.gather(*validation_tasks)
        
        # Stage 3: Settlement calculation with context
        settlement = await agents['calculator'].calculate(
            claim=intake_result,
            validation=validation_result,
            fraud_score=fraud_result.score
        )
        
        return ClaimDecision(
            claim_id=claim_id,
            decision=settlement.decision,
            amount=settlement.amount,
            confidence=min(validation_result.confidence, fraud_result.confidence),
            explanation=self.generate_explanation(settlement)
        )
```

### Production RAG Implementation
```python
class InsuranceRAGPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedder = SentenceTransformer('multilingual-e5-large')
        self.vector_store = Pinecone(index='insurance-policies')
        self.reranker = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2')
        self.cache = Redis()
        
    async def retrieve_and_generate(self, query: str, context: dict):
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = self.generate_cache_key(query, context)
        if cached := await self.cache.get(cache_key):
            return cached
            
        # Hybrid retrieval
        dense_results = await self.dense_retrieval(query)
        sparse_results = await self.sparse_retrieval(query)
        
        # Fusion and reranking
        fused = self.reciprocal_rank_fusion(dense_results, sparse_results)
        reranked = self.reranker.rerank(query, fused, top_k=5)
        
        # Generate with streaming
        response = await self.generate_with_context(
            query=query,
            context=reranked,
            user_context=context
        )
        
        # Cache for 1 hour
        await self.cache.setex(cache_key, 3600, response)
        
        return response
```

## Interview Talking Points

### For System Design Questions:
> "I architected a multi-agent system processing 100K claims monthly. The key was designing specialized agents that could work in parallel - document intake, validation, and fraud detection run concurrently, reducing latency by 70%."

### For Scale Questions:
> "We handled 50K concurrent users during insurance renewal season. The solution was horizontal scaling with Kubernetes, Redis caching reducing DB load by 80%, and a CDN for static assets."

### For AI/ML Questions:
> "Our RAG system achieved 91% accuracy by implementing hybrid search. We used dense retrieval with E5 embeddings for semantic search, BM25 for keyword matching, and cross-encoder reranking. This reduced hallucinations from 5% to 0.1%."

### For Business Impact:
> "Beyond the technical implementation, I focused on business metrics. We reduced claim processing costs by 60% and improved customer satisfaction from 3.2 to 4.8 stars. The system paid for itself in 3 months."
