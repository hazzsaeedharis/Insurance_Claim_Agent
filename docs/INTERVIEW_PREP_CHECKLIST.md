## Code Challenges to Practice

### 1. **Live Coding: Build a Simple Agent**
```python
# 30-minute challenge: Build a customer service agent
class CustomerServiceAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = ConversationMemory()
        self.tools = [SearchTool(), CalculatorTool(), EmailTool()]
        
    async def handle_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Your implementation here
        pass
```

### 2. **System Design: Scale to 1M Users**
- Draw architecture diagram
- Calculate resource requirements
- Design data pipeline
- Plan deployment strategy

### 3. **Debug Production Issue**
```python
# Given: Agent returning inconsistent results
# Task: Find and fix the issue
# Hint: Check context management and memory leaks
```

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Describe your experience with multi-agent systems"
**Your Answer:**
> "I designed and deployed a multi-agent insurance claims system processing 100K+ claims monthly. The architecture uses 5 specialized agents - intake, validation, fraud detection, settlement, and notification - orchestrated through an async workflow engine. 

> The key innovation was implementing shared memory using Redis for inter-agent communication, allowing agents to build on each other's work. This reduced processing time by 85% while maintaining 99.9% accuracy.

> I used LangGraph for complex reasoning chains and implemented custom evaluation metrics to ensure agent coordination quality."

### Q2: "How do you handle LLM hallucinations in production?"
**Your Answer:**
> "I implemented a three-layer defense system:

> 1. **Input Layer**: Constrained prompts with explicit boundaries and examples
> 2. **Processing Layer**: RAG with relevance thresholds (>0.8) and fact-checking against authoritative sources
> 3. **Output Layer**: Structured output validation and confidence scoring

> In production, this reduced hallucination rates from 5% to 0.1%. We also implemented a feedback loop where flagged outputs retrain our validation models."

### Q3: "Walk me through your RAG implementation"
**Your Answer:**
> "Our RAG pipeline handles 10M+ insurance documents in German and English:

> 1. **Ingestion**: Documents are chunked with 20% overlap, embedded using multilingual-E5
> 2. **Storage**: Pinecone for vectors, PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching
> 3. **Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining dense (semantic) and sparse (BM25) retrieval
> 4. **Reranking**: Cross-encoder model reranks top 100 results to final top 5
> 5. **Generation**: Context injection with relevance weighting

> This achieved 91% accuracy on insurance policy questions, with p95 latency under 200ms."

### Q4: "How do you measure success in AI systems?"
**Your Answer:**
> "I track metrics across three dimensions:

> **Business Impact**: ROI (320% in our case), cost reduction (60%), processing speed (85% faster)
> **Technical Excellence**: Latency (p99 < 250ms), accuracy (99.9%), uptime (99.95%)
> **User Experience**: NPS improved from 32 to 72, CSAT at 4.8/5

> I implemented comprehensive A/B testing, allowing us to test new models safely. For example, adjusting our fraud threshold through A/B testing improved catch rate by 12% without increasing false positives."

## Behavioral Questions Prep

### "Tell me about a challenging technical problem"
**Structure**: Situation â†’ Task â†’ Action â†’ Result

**Your Story**:
> "When we first deployed, our system couldn't handle peak load during insurance renewal season. 50K concurrent users caused memory issues and 30-second latencies.

> I led a team to redesign the architecture, implementing:
> - Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
> - Redis caching reducing DB queries by 80%
> - Async processing for non-critical paths
> - Circuit breakers preventing cascade failures

> Result: System now handles 100K concurrent users with p99 latency under 250ms."

### "How do you stay current with AI/ML?"
**Your Answer**:
> "I follow a structured approach:
> 1. **Research**: Read 2-3 papers weekly (currently focusing on agent architectures)
> 2. **Practice**: Implement new techniques in side projects
> 3. **Community**: Active in LangChain Discord, contribute to open source
> 4. **Production**: Apply learnings to real systems, measure impact

> For example, I recently implemented Microsoft's GraphRAG approach, improving our retrieval accuracy by 15%."
