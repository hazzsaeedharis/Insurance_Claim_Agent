```javascript
// OCR Integration Example
const processDocument = async (fileUrl) => {
  try {
    const response = await ocrService.extractText(fileUrl);
    if (response.confidence < 0.8) {
      // Flag for manual review
      await flagForManualReview(claimId, 'Low OCR confidence');
    }
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to alternative service
    return await fallbackOCRService.extractText(fileUrl);
  }
};
```

#### Fraud Detection
```javascript
// Fraud Scoring Integration
const assessFraudRisk = async (claimData) => {
  const riskFactors = [
    checkClaimHistory(claimData.userId),
    validateIncidentDetails(claimData.incident),
    analyzePolicyPatterns(claimData.policyId),
    crossReferenceExternalData(claimData)
  ];
  
  const riskScore = await fraudModel.score(riskFactors);
  
  if (riskScore > 0.7) {
    await createInvestigationCase(claimData.claimId);
  }
  
  return riskScore;
};
```

    claimId,
    status,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    message: getStatusMessage(status)
  });
};

// Admin dashboard updates
const notifyAdminQueue = (queueStats) => {
  io.to('admin-room').emit('queueUpdate', {
