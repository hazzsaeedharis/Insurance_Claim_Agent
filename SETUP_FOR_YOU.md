# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide - For Your Configuration

Based on what you have:
- ‚úÖ Groq API key
- ‚úÖ Gemini API key  
- ‚úÖ Pinecone API key (environment unknown - **not needed, we'll use ChromaDB locally**)
- ‚ùå No OpenAI API key (that's fine!)

## Your Perfect Setup (FREE!)

You already have everything you need for the **BEST possible setup** - all for FREE! üéâ

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script

```powershell
.\setup-api-keys.ps1
```

When prompted:
1. **Groq API Key**: Paste your key
2. **Gemini API Key**: Paste your key (or skip if no credit card) 
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Just press Enter (skip it)

### Step 2: Test Your Setup

```powershell
python test_ai_processing.py
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ Groq for fast operations
- ‚úÖ Gemini for high-quality extraction and embeddings
- ‚úÖ ChromaDB for local vector storage (no Pinecone needed)

## What Happens With Your Keys?

### Priority System:
1. **Gemini** (primary) - Used for:
   - Document extraction
   - Policy analysis
   - Embeddings (FREE!)
   - Claim matching

2. **Groq** (fast operations) - Used for:
   - Quick classification
   - Backup when Gemini rate limits hit

### Why This Is Perfect:

| Feature | Your Setup | Cost |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Document Processing | Gemini 1.5 Pro | FREE |
| Policy Embeddings | Gemini embeddings | FREE |
| Claim Analysis | Gemini 1.5 Pro | FREE |
| Rate Limit | 60 requests/min | FREE |
| German Language | Excellent | FREE |
| **Total** | **Professional Grade** | **$0** |

## About Pinecone

You mentioned you have a Pinecone API key but don't know the environment.

**Good news**: You don't need it! Here's why:

- **ChromaDB** (local, free): Perfect for development and MVP
- **Pinecone** (cloud, paid): Only needed for production scale (100K+ documents)

We're using ChromaDB by default, which:
- ‚úÖ Runs locally on your machine
- ‚úÖ No setup needed
- ‚úÖ Perfect for testing and development
- ‚úÖ Handles thousands of documents easily

If you later need Pinecone, the environment is usually like:
- `us-east-1-aws`
- `eu-west-1-aws`
- `asia-southeast1-gcp`

But again, **you don't need it right now**!

## Your .env File Should Look Like:

```env
# Required
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_key_here

# Recommended (FREE!)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

# Not needed
OPENAI_API_KEY=
PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=
```

## Quick Commands

```powershell
# Create .env file
.\setup-api-keys.ps1

# Test the system
python test_ai_processing.py

# Check Groq models available
.\check-groq-models.ps1

# Start the AI service
cd services/ai_processing
python api.py
```

## What You Get With This Setup

‚úÖ **FREE tier** for everything
‚úÖ **60 requests/minute** with Gemini
‚úÖ **30 requests/minute** with Groq
‚úÖ **Excellent German** language support
‚úÖ **2M token context** window (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
‚úÖ **768-dimension embeddings** (Gemini)
‚úÖ **Local vector database** (ChromaDB)

## Summary

You're all set! You have:
1. ‚úÖ Groq API key (required)
2. ‚úÖ Gemini API key (perfect for quality!)
3. ‚ùå OpenAI not needed (Gemini is better for free)
4. ‚ùå Pinecone not needed (ChromaDB works great)

Just run `.\setup-api-keys.ps1` and you're good to go! üöÄ
