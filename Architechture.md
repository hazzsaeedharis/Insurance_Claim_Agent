üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

Core modules you‚Äôll need:

Document Intake & OCR

Use German-optimized OCR (e.g., Tesseract with Fraktur/Gothic training, or AWS Textract/Google Document AI with German language packs).

Pre-processing: noise reduction, skew correction, table/receipt parsing.

Policy Validation Engine

Encode Hallesche NK.select S and TK statutory terms as machine-readable rules.

Support rule-based decisioning (coverage %, deductible, exclusions).

Flexible rules engine (Drools, Camunda DMN, or custom rules microservice).

Fraud Detection

Train ML models on historical German claims data (supervised anomaly detection, NLP for notes).

Rule-based checks (duplicate invoices, excessive claims, treatment mismatches).

Risk scoring per claim ‚Üí auto-flag to adjuster queue.

Settlement Calculation Engine

Input: extracted claim items, validated policy terms.

Output: breakdown of payable vs. non-payable items, deductibles, co-pays.

Communication & Output Generator

Template-based letters in German & English (use docx/HTML template engine).

Customer notifications (email, SMS, portal updates).

Regulatory-compliant wording for denials.

Payments & Banking Integration

Integrate with SEPA payments via German banking APIs.

Automatic reconciliation with claim ID.

Handle refunds/partial settlements.

Analytics & Audit Trail

Immutable event log (blockchain ledger optional).

KPIs: automation %, average processing time, fraud detection rate.

Regulatory reporting (BaFin compliance).

üîê Compliance & Regulatory Notes (Germany)

GDPR: strict handling of personal health data, need pseudonymization + role-based access.

BaFin / GKV-Spitzenverband oversight: compliance reporting similar to IRDAI (but for German statutory/private insurers).

eGK (Elektronische Gesundheitskarte) integration: for future proofing.

‚ö° Performance Targets

Scalability: Cloud-native (Kubernetes + autoscaling).

Claim throughput: 1000+ per day ‚Üí need parallel OCR workers + async pipelines.

Automation target: ‚â•95% ‚Äústraight-through‚Äù processing.

Latency goal: <5 minutes avg (batch + real-time hybrid processing).

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (suggestion)

OCR & NLP: Google Document AI, Azure Form Recognizer, or Tesseract + spaCy (DE models).

Workflow Engine: Camunda / Temporal for claims orchestration.

Rules Engine: Drools / OpenL Tablets for policy logic.

Fraud ML: Scikit-learn / PyTorch anomaly detection.

Frontend: React + Tailwind (multi-role portals).

Backend: Python/FastAPI or Java/Spring Boot microservices.

Storage: PostgreSQL + MinIO/S3 for document storage.

Security: Keycloak for auth, encrypted storage (AES-256), TLS everywhere.

‚úÖ With this setup, you‚Äôll have a system flexible enough for Hallesche and TK while being extensible to other German insurers.
